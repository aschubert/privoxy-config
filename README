This is my Privoxy configuration.

NOTE: My configuration blocks Facebook. 


Installing on Mac OS X
======================

    # Install Privoxy through Homebrew
    brew install privoxy

    # Move the original Privoxy configuration out of the way.
    mv /usr/local/etc/privoxy/ /usr/local/etc/orig.privoxy

    # Clone the new Privoxy configuration into /usr/local/etc/privoxy
    git clone git://github.com/fdb/privoxy-config.git /usr/local/etc/privoxy

    # Copy the launch agent script to the global launch agents.
    sudo cp /usr/local/etc/privoxy/launch-agent/org.privoxy.privoxy.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/

    # Change the user permissions to root (Otherwise the script will not load)
    sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchAgents/org.privoxy.privoxy.plist 

    # Load and start the script now.
    launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/org.privoxy.privoxy.plist 
    launchctl start org.privoxy.privoxy
